Things to do... (there's quite a bit to be done)

Refactoring:
	* Fix that god-awful README.  I'm working on it, but it's a pretty poor attemt at using GFM to 
		generate a table.
	* Still need to continue to refactor most of the codebase
	* When refactorization is mostly complete, add a comment over the import statement in start.py

Features:
	* Possibly add a code-style file describing how not to contribute

Bugs:
	* Configuration file input/output issues need to be fixed.
