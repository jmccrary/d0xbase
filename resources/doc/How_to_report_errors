Reporting bugs, glitches and errors should be in a free form,

 * What system are you running (as exact as possible)
 * If system is Linux/Unix - what Window-Manager are you using
 * What did you do before the error has occured
 * What happened when it occured
 * What error did you get
 * If you can, copy the whole error log and send it to pastebin
   or similar website. Include the link in the report,
   or if the error log not very long just send it via email.
   Usualy 5-10 last lines of output are enough.
